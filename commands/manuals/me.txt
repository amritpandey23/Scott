Mr. Scott | BASIC USAGE GUIDE

Hi there! My name is Scott, I am a friendly chatbot assistant
for discord servers. 

To use any command, just run it with a prefix like this:
    >>> <prefix>define wiki game of thrones

Each command has a prefix like \, $, %, ^ etc. followed by
command arguments. To read how to use a specific command 
take the help from 'help' command.
    >>> <prefix>help define

To list all the available commands, just run
    >>> <prefix>bot commands

Thats it! Thanks for reading. Bye ğŸ‘‹
