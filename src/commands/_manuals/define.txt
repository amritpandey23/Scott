GUIDE
  !define will only show definition on receiving exact info,
  in case a word have more than one meaning, related topics
  (not more than three) will be displayed. To get more acc-
  urate results pass more keywords in search phrase sepearted  
  with spaces. Eg: 'react' means many things but if you want 
  to get definition for 'reactjs' use command like this:
  > !define reactjs
          OR
  > !define wiki react javascript
  For now, !define only provide information about things, places,
  events, news etc. and does not provide meaning of the words from
  english dictionary. DDG bang redirects will also not work here.
